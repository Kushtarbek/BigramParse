# _TheBigramParse_

#### By _**Kushtar Tynarbekov**_

## Description

\_A bigram is any two adjacent words in the text disregarding case and punctuation. A histogram is the count of how many times that particular bigram occurred in the text.

A well-formed submission will be runnable from command line and have accompanying unit tests for the bigram parsing and counting code. You may do this in any language you wish and use any framework or data structures you wish to handle reading the files, building up the output, and running the unit tests. However the bigram parsing and counting code must be implemented by yourself.\_
